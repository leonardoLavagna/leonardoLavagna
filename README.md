<h2 align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonardoLavagna/leonardoLavagna/main/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" /> Hi, I'm Leonardo Lavagna (Leo) <br /><br /> A Mathematician and Data Science Enthusiast from Italy</h2>

I'm a mathematician specialized in data science currently pursuing a PhD in quantum computing at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) in the [Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET)](https://web.uniroma1.it/dip_diet/en) in the [Neural Network Systems & Applications Laboratory (NESYA)](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya) multidisciplinary lab. Before starting my journey in quantum computing I've worked as an IT consultant and as a data scientist for a consulting firm in Rome. I enjoy multidisciplinarity, working both independently and in groups. More generally, I am passionate about participating in innovative projects that contribute to the improvement of society and the environment. Here I share some parts of my work as well as those projects I carry out in my free time and which are helping me grow, both personally and professionally.
