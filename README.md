<h2 align="center"> 👋 Hi, I'm Leonardo Lavagna <br /><br /> A Mathematician and Data Science Enthusiast from Italy</h2>
I'm a Data Scientist at Unilab (an Italian consulting firm active primarely in the fields of pharmaceutics and biotechnology). I deal mainly with modeling (biology, physics, statistics), data analysis (machine learning, deep learning), cybersecurity (cryptography), and optimization. I enjoy multidisciplinarity, working both independently and in groups. More generally, I am passionate about participating in innovative projects that contribute to the improvement of society and the environment. Here I share some parts of my work as well as those projects I carry out in my free time and which are helping me grow, both personally and professionally.
